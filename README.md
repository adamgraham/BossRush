# [Boss Rush](https://adamgraham.io/games/boss-rush)

> Boss Rush is a top-down, twin-stick shooter consisting of nothing but boss fights. Developed with a team of seven people for a course at DePaul University, the objective was to create a slice of a complete game, so it consists of one action-packed boss fight â€“ the Spider Tank.
